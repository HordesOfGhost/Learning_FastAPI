# Typing in Python refers to the use of type hints or type annotations to indicate the expected types of variables, function parameters, and return values. This feature was introduced in Python 3.5 via PEP 484. Although Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare the type of a variable, type hints can be used to make the code more understandable and easier to debug.

# Here are some key points about typing in Python:

# Basic Syntax
# Function Annotations:
# Parameters: Type hints are placed after the parameter name and a colon.
# Return Type: The return type is specified after the parameters and an arrow (->).
# python
# Copy code
# def greet(name: str) -> str:
#     return f"Hello, {name}"
# Variable Annotations:
# Variables can also have type hints.
# python
# Copy code
# age: int = 25
# name: str = "Alice"
# Typing Module
# Python's typing module provides several types and utilities to support type hints.

# Basic Types:

# int, str, float, bool, etc.
# Generic Types:

# List, Dict, Tuple, Set, etc.
# python
# Copy code
# from typing import List, Dict

# numbers: List[int] = [1, 2, 3]
# user_info: Dict[str, int] = {"age": 30, "id": 1234}
# Optional Type:
# Used when a variable can be of a specified type or None.
# python
# Copy code
# from typing import Optional

# def get_user_id(user: Optional[str]) -> Optional[int]:
#     if user:
#         return 123
#     return None
# Union Type:
# Used when a variable can be one of several types.
# python
# Copy code
# from typing import Union

# def process_input(data: Union[int, str]) -> str:
#     return str(data)
# Any Type:
# Used when a variable can be of any type.
# python
# Copy code
# from typing import Any

# def log_message(message: Any) -> None:
#     print(message)
# Advanced Typing
# Type Aliases:
# Used to create shorthand for complex types.
# python
# Copy code
# from typing import List, Tuple

# Vector = List[Tuple[int, int]]

# def process_vector(vector: Vector) -> None:
#     for x, y in vector:
#         print(x, y)
# Custom Types:
# Create user-defined types using TypedDict or classes.
# python
# Copy code
# from typing import TypedDict

# class User(TypedDict):
#     name: str
#     age: int

# user: User = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
# Benefits of Typing
# Readability: Code with type hints is easier to read and understand.
# Tooling: Many IDEs and editors use type hints to provide better autocompletion and inline error checking.
# Static Analysis: Tools like mypy can be used to perform static type checking, helping to catch errors before runtime.
# Example
# Here's a more comprehensive example combining several features:

# python
# Copy code
# from typing import List, Dict, Optional

# def find_user(users: List[Dict[str, str]], user_id: str) -> Optional[Dict[str, str]]:
#     for user in users:
#         if user['id'] == user_id:
#             return user
#     return None

# users = [
#     {"id": "1", "name": "Alice"},
#     {"id": "2", "name": "Bob"}
# ]

# print(find_user(users, "1"))
# In this example, the find_user function uses type hints to indicate it expects a list of dictionaries and returns either a dictionary or None.
